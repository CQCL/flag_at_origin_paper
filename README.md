# flag_at_origin_paper
Provides the numerical results presented in the paper for reproducibility. It includes the FT circuits constructed for various CSS codes.

To use a Notebook, clone the repository, then download and unzip the corresponding ZIP file. 

Running the notebooks requires Python 3.12.7 or later and Pytket 1.40.0 or later.

Notebook1: Contains the simulation and hardware results, as well as the JSON files of the FT state preparation circuits.

Notebook2: Implements the FT flag gadgets as a function of the code distance and the target qubits.

Notebook3: Provides a function to obtain the FT state preparation circuits in pytket, Qiskit, and Stim formats. Additionally, it allows displaying the stabilizers for all the codes used.
